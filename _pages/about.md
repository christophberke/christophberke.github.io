## Hello and welcome on my homepage!
I'm a theoretical and computational physicist with a Ph.D. in physics from the university of Cologne and expertise in quantum computation and condensed matter physics.

In my research, I use a mix of analytical and numerical methods to advance the understanding of quantum materials and technology. Recently, my work has centered on transmon-based quantum computers, exploring how multi-qubit processors behave and uncovering potential many-body effects that could compromise the functionality of quantum hardware. Understanding these challenges is key to scaling quantum systems and ensuring their reliability for practical use.
This project was a collaboration with [Simon Trebst](https://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/trebst/index.shtml), [Alex Altland](https://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/alexal/index.html), and [David DiVincenzo](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/divincenzo_d) through [ML4Q](https://ml4q.de) and [CRC183](https://www.crc183.uni-koeln.de). I also investigated the behavior of Kitaev spin liquids under magnetic fields with [Ciaran Hickey](https://people.ucd.ie/ciaran.hickey) and [Simon Trebst](https://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/trebst/index.shtml). Before my time in Cologne, I worked with [Carsten Timm](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/physik/itp/cmt/die-professur/inhaber) in Dresden, studying Weyl semimetals.

In addition to my research, I’m passionate about science communication and public outreach. I’ve led workshops, delivered public talks, and participated in various events aimed at explaining the mysteries of quantum physics and quantum computation. You can find more details about my outreach efforts [here](/outreach).
