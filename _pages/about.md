Hello! I'm a theoretical and computational physicist with expertise in quantum computation and condensed matter physics.

In my research, I use a mix of analytic and numerical methods to advance the understanding of transmon-based quantum computers. My work aims to uncover new many-body effects im multi-qubit processorsâ€”effects that could potentially compromise the functionality of quantum hardware. Understanding these challenges is crucial for scaling up quantum systems and ensuring their reliability in practical applications.
This project, a collaboration with Simon Trebst, Alex Altland and David DiVincenzo, brought together through ML4Q and CRC183, earned me my Ph.D. in physics from the University of Cologne. I also delved into the behavior of Kitaev spin liquids under magnetic fields, working with Ciaran Hickey and Simon Trebst. Prior to my time in Cologne, I explored Weyl semimetals with Prof. Carsten Timm in Dresden.

In addition to my research, I'm also passionate about science communication and public outreach. I've led workshops, delivered public talks, and participated in various events aimed at explaining the mysteries of quantum physics and quantum computation, see
[here](/outreach) for more details.
